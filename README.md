## Notes

1. Use Grid for Layouting the gallery, other elements feel free to use whatever you want (grid, flex)

2. For Gallery item type (image, video, album) use positioning

3. display (likes, comments) stats icons only while hovering (or focusing) on the gallery item, by default their display is none

4. for the gallery images use free images provider like (unsplash.com) – and try to search for single topic (personal, nature, tech, architecture, or anything else)
